# RcppLCA
## Latent Class Analysis using RcppArmadillo
A reimplementation of poLCA
\[[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poLCA/index.html),
[GitHub](https://github.com/dlinzer/poLCA)\] in RcppArmadillo. It tries to reproduce
results and be as similar as possible to the original code but runs faster,
especially with multiple repetitions by using multiple threads.
